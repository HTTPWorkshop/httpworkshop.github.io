title: The HTTP Workshop Code of Conduct
layout: page
---

The HTTP Workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all attendees, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or ethnicity. We do not tolerate harassment in any form, and reserve the right to determine what qualifies as harassment.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in Workshop talks or discussions, or in related events or online fora. 

Attendees violating these rules may expelled from the Workshop at the discretion of the program committee. If you experience or witness a violation, please contact any member of the program committee.

We ask that attendees assume good faith in all discussions, and that while ideas should be held to close scrutiny, they should be clearly separated from the people advocating for them.
