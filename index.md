# The HTTP Workshop

The HTTP Workshop is an occasional gathering of HTTP experts to discuss the Web's foundational protocol.
{: .banner}

It is largely unstructured, promoting unfiltered discussion among the major implementers and
practitioners of HTTP. We have a few "anchor" talks to stimulate discussion, but expect attendees
to drive most of the agenda. Our goals are to:

* **Encourage** discussion and understanding between different parts of the HTTP community
* **Identify** areas of work or specific efforts that have common interest, to foster further work (in standards bodies and in implementations)
* **Ensure** broad input into future development of the protocol

Note that it is **not** a decision-making body; see the [HTTP Working Group](http://httpwg.org).

Past HTTP Workshops include:

* [2015 in MÃ¼nster, Germany](https://github.com/HTTPWorkshop/workshop2015/wiki/2015-Report)
* [2016 in Stockholm, Sweden](https://github.com/HTTPWorkshop/workshop2016/wiki/Report)

**The 2017 HTTP Workshop will be held on 12-13 June in London -- [Find out more](https://github.com/HTTPWorkshop/workshop2017/blob/master/README.md)**.


## Who Should Come

We anticipate most major HTTP implementations being represented, including browsers, servers,
intermediaries, libraries, and tools.

In addition, we'd like to see active participation from practitioners at scale. If you work with
large-scale HTTP deployments, whether that's serving "traditional" Web pages or using HTTP for
back-end APIs, please consider attending.

Finally, if you are a student working in a relevant area, this is a great opportunity to gain
insight into this community.
