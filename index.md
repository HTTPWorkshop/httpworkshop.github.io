# The HTTP Workshop

HTTP/1.1 has been revised and HTTP/2 is out the door. What -- if anything --
should the HTTP community focus on next? What will HTTP look like in ten or
even twenty years?

Lots of people have ideas about this, but don't have a chance to discuss their
ideas with other HTTP implementers. Because the uses of HTTP differ so greatly
-- even between browsers and Web servers -- it's difficult to understand all
of the impact of a proposal without getting a number of people in the room.

The HTTP Workshop is an attempt to facilitate these discussions in a focused
atmosphere, with representation from many kinds of stakeholders in the HTTP
ecosystem.

Our goals are to:

* **Encourage** discussion and understanding between different parts of the HTTP community
* **Identify** areas of work or specific efforts that have common interest, to foster further work (e.g., in standards bodies)
* **Ensure** broad input into future development of the protocol


## When and Where

The workshop will be held in MÃ¼nster Germany, 27-30 July 2015. Exact details
will be sent to participants upon registration.

We are purposefully holding the workshop in a somewhat "out of the way"
location; we want you engaged with the other participants, not popping out to
visit an office or talk to a customer.

We expect that each day will cover about two broad areas of discussion,
possibly with presentations, or just open discussion. There will be plenty of
unstructured time for "hallway" discussions, as well as social events.

There is a **200 Euro** fee for participation to cover costs; lunch, drinks and
snacks will be included.


## Want to Come?

We have limited space, and want to make sure the discussion is valuable for
those who attend. So, a program committee will select attendees based upon
submissions.

We're looking for submissions that:

* Explore problems in existing HTTP implementations and/or deployments
* Propose ways to improve core aspects of HTTP such as performance, security, or reliability 
* Define useful extensions to HTTP
* Motivate work on HTTP/3 (or beyond), with or without the constraint of backwards compatibility

... or something completely different.

Your submission doesn't necessarily need to be a complete paper or
presentation; it just needs to communicate something about HTTP that's worth
getting in front of a group of HTTP implementers and experts.

Successful submissions will be notified of the workshop details by 
**15 May 2015**, and will need to confirm their attendance by **1 June 2015**.
If the PC wants you to give a presentation based upon your submission, you'll
be notified shortly thereafter.

Note that a successful submission only entitles the primary author to attend;
if your company or project wishes to send multiple participants, it is best for
them to send separate submissions.

All attendees will be expected to adhere to the [Conference Code of
Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com). We will publish a summary of what
happens at the workshop, but will only publish submissions if their authors
request it.

Please make submissions to
[easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=httpws2015) by **1 May
2015**.
