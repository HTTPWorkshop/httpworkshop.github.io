# The HTTP Workshop

<div class="banner">
<p>HTTP/1.1 has been revised and HTTP/2 is out the door.</p>
<p>What should the HTTP community focus on next?</p>
<p>What will the protocol look like in ten or even twenty years?</p>
</div>

Lots of people have ideas about the future of HTTP, but don't have a chance to
discuss their ideas with others. Because the uses of HTTP differ so greatly --
even between browsers and Web servers -- it's difficult to understand all of
the impact of a proposal without getting a number of people in the room.

The HTTP Workshop is an attempt to facilitate these discussions in a focused
atmosphere, with representation from many kinds of stakeholders in the HTTP
ecosystem.

Our goals are to:

* **Encourage** discussion and understanding between different parts of the HTTP community
* **Identify** areas of work or specific efforts that have common interest, to foster further work (in standards bodies and in implementations)
* **Ensure** broad input into future development of the protocol


## When and Where

The workshop will be held in MÃ¼nster Germany, 27-30 July 2015. Details will be
sent to participants upon registration.

We are purposefully holding the workshop in a somewhat "out of the way"
location; we want you engaged with the other participants, not popping out to
visit an office or talk to a customer.

We expect that each day will cover about two broad areas of discussion,
possibly with presentations, or just open discussion. There will be plenty of
unstructured time for "hallway" discussions.


## Want to Come?

We have limited space, and want to make sure the discussion is valuable for
those who attend. So, a program committee will select attendees based upon
submissions.

We're looking for submissions that:

* Explore problems in existing HTTP **implementations** and/or **deployments**
* Propose ways to improve core aspects of HTTP such as **performance**, **security**, or **reliability** 
* Define useful **extensions** to HTTP
* Motivate work on **HTTP/3** (or beyond), with or without the constraint of backwards compatibility

... or something completely different. If you are the primary maintainer of an
implementation of HTTP, please mention its details in your submission.

Submissions don't need to be a complete paper or presentation; they just need
to communicate something about HTTP that's worth getting in front of a group of
HTTP implementers and experts.

Submitters of successful submissions will be notified of the workshop details
by **15 May 2015**, and will need to confirm their attendance by **1 June
2015**. If the PC wants you to give a presentation based upon your submission,
you'll be notified shortly thereafter.

Note that a successful submission only entitles the primary author to attend;
if your organisation or project wishes to send multiple participants, it is
best to send separate submissions. We will be limiting representation from
single companies and projects to assure balanced participation.

There is an approximately **200 Euro** fee for participation to cover costs;
lunch, drinks and snacks will be included.

All attendees will be expected to adhere to the [Conference Code of
Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com). We will publish a summary of what
happens at the workshop, but will only publish submissions if their authors
request it.

Please make submissions to
[easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=httpws2015) by **1 May
2015**.
